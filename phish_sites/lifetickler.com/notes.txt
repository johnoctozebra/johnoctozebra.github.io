All forms original go to .php page then takes you to the next form page. The PHP most likely just stored and/or sends the data to phisher then redirects user. Thus, HTML code has been changed to go directly to the next form. Original forms are commented out above new fors. 

From the query username=some_email should automatically fill in the username field and make it uneditable. This seems to be server side script and can not be relicated even with the correct URL parameters. 

Clicking on submit (any bogus one over 3 characters) should take them to a second page phishing for a phone number. That could not be scraped. That page is scraped seperately.
