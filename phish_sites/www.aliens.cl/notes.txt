I was unable to scrape the main phishing page, which impresonated Google's login page pretty well without the drop down menu for other email providers that others usually have because a 404 page was given to users not using IE and I was unable to get the request headers to match IE before the site was down. 

After entering login information the user is presented with the verfication page to verify your phone number. After that form it takes you to the legitimate Google sing in page.
