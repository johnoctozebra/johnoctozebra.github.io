Actual site now gives a 403 forbidden and no longer works. After putting in bogus credentials into either Office, Aol, or Other log in, it will also give you a 403 Forbidden message as that was not properly scraped. The original phishing site took any credentials and took you to the page. 

Because of the filename size limit, folders and filenames  had to manually be renamed and changed in HTML to work. 

/davidlindner.net/ .. -> /davidlindner.net/hi


The following three phishing login site names where changed because they were too long for server.
