Forms originally go to .php (presumably to store credentials) and does not verif
y if email is in correct format or if forms or empty. The .php script redirects
the user to a different domain showing a PDF. This PDF was downloaded and links
to the php script goes to that PDF file to replicate the behavior. All original
HTML code has been commented out and new code is under them.

The original URL for the PDF: http://www.fmbwealth.com/sites/default/files/CEG_JWMC_evan_article_pages_with_foto.pdf looks benign and was chosen randomly.
