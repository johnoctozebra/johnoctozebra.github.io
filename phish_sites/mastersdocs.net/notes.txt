Forms go to php then to next form. They have been commented out and replaced with the next HTML form. After phishing for phone number, an animation is played for several seconds which then redirect the user to the legitimate docusign.com homepage. Currently this loader only plays animation then displays a no page exists error as the original PHP script redirects which could not be scraped.
